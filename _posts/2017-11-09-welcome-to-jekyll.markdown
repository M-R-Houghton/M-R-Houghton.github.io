I'm Mark, a 2nd year PhD student at the University of Leeds. I hope to use this site to share information about my skills, interests, and current research.

I may get around to discussing code snippets: 
{% highlight c %}
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	// some program
	return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
But that will depend how often I update this blog.

You can also find me on [LinkedIn][linkedin], and you'll find my code on [GitHub][github] and [GitLab][gitlab], although at the time of writing these are all pretty bare and don't represent anything I've been working in the last 2-3 years!
